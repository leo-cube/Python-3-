# Lesson 3:
# 1. even_numbers: printing even numbers vertically
even_numbers = []
for value in range(2,25,2):
	even_number = value
	even_numbers.append(even_number)
	print(even_number)
 # even_numbers inside a list
print('\t')
# 2. even_numbers inside a list:
even_numbers = []
for value in range(4,25,4):
	even_number=value
	even_numbers.append(even_number)
print(even_numbers) 
print('\n')
# 3. Printing squares in briefly and comprehensively
squares = []
for value in range(2,15):
	square = value ** 2
	squares.append(square)
print(squares)

# 4. Min, Max and Sum
print('\n')
dig = [4,8,0,1,5,4,3]
print(max(dig))
print(min(dig))
print(sum(dig))
print(len(dig))

# 5. Comprehension way of writing a code:
squares = [value**2 for value in range(2,15)] # here square brackets is important in here:
print(squares)

# 6. SLICING a list;
colors = ['blue','green','pink','yellow','red','orange']
print(colors[0:3])
print(colors[:-1])# after neglecting the -1 it prints the remaining things

# 7. Looping through a slice:
print('\t ')
colors = ['blue','green','pink','yellow','red','orange']
for color in colors[0:4]:
	print(color.upper())
# 8. Copying a list[:]
color = ['blue','green','pink','yellow','red','orange']
colour_new = ['baneya','june']
colour_new=color[:]
print(colour_new)	
print('\t')

# 9. TUPLE:
nam = ('hey','wat','yes','tom')
print(nam[0])
print(nam[-1])
print('"Tuple object does not support item assignment - achieved"')
print('\t')

# 10. Using if and else: SPACES provide a very important role here for what to print and what not to:
names = ['george','david','clooney','willy']
for name in names:
	if name == 'george':
    	 print('You are free to go ' + name.title())
	else:
         print('You are not allowed to leave ' + name.title())
# 11. Conditional Test: this includes = <= >= == < > and Numericals:
print('\t')
age = 21
print(age == 21)
print(age <= 21)
print(age >= 21)
print(age > 21)
print(age < 21)
print(age!= 21)
	  	 
	# LESSON-4:
# 1. Not equals to !=
color = ['blue','green','pink','yellow','red','orange']
if color != 'black':
  print("black is missing")

# 2. and condition :
print('\t')
mary = 'george'
alice = 'kenny'
print(mary != 'george' and alice == 'kenny') 
print('\t')
# or condition: either one can be true and other is false or both true
print(mary != 'george' or alice == 'kenny') 
# 3. Finding the value in the list:
color = ['blue','green','pink','yellow','red','orange']
print('blue' in color) # nice here the condition turns to be true
print('pink' not in color) # ok not in has generated false statement

# 4. If statement:
age = 15
if age != 15:
	print("super") # here python does not prints the string inside if condition:
if age < 15:
 print('wow') # the age must be 15, lesser than 15 is not valid stuff
if age >= 15:
	print("yes this is right") 	# the equals to symbol defines the value 15 to the string so it prints

print('\t')
# 5. if - else statement:
age = 23
if age < 23:
	print('You cannot date me') # here python is seeing false so it passes on to the next condition checks it and then passes it
else:
	print('You can date me')
	
side_dishes = ['gotii','chicken','sausage']
if 'channa' in side_dishes: # coz channa is not in the side_dishes so python passed on to the else condition;
	print('Bring on')
else:
	print('Bring chicken')		
print('\t')

# 6. if-elif-else:
side_dishes = ['pizza','pasta','burger','coke','popcorn','beer']
if 'tomato' in side_dishes:
	print('no thanks')
elif 'pizza' in side_dishes: # here the stuff from side_dishes is in here so python stops here and shows the result
	print('No')
else: 
	print('Bring me pasta atleast')		
print('\t')	 
	
# 7. if-elif:
side_dishes = ['pizza','pasta','burger','coke','popcorn','beer']
if 'jackberry' in side_dishes:
	print('no')
elif 'blueberry' in side_dishes:
	print('yes')
elif 'coke' in side_dishes:
	print('Bring it on baby')	# here there are multiple elif so python stops checking when it found the crect one
	
# 8. Only if but multiple if condition:
side_dishes = ['pizza','pasta','burger','coke','popcorn','beer']
if 'popcorn' in side_dishes:
	print('oh yeaa')	
if 'beer' in side_dishes:
	print('cool baby')
if 'ketchup' in side_dishes:
	print("nah, I'm cool here ") # This one got rejected becoz we have encountered a problem here
if 'pizza' in side_dishes:
	print('bring it on baby')
