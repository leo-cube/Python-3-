# LESSON 1:
# 1. print hello world
print("LESSON 1:")
print("hello world")

# 2. A string is something that is within quotation "" or ''
"hey this is a string" and 'this is also a string'

# 3. upper and lower and title:
message = "hey This is Ranbo"
print(message.upper())
print(message.lower())
print(message.title())

# 4. Combining and Concatenating:
message_1 = "Hey"
message_2 = ", whats up!"
message = message_1 +""+ message_2
print(message)

# 5. Adding whitespaces this is one of the important things to do: \n creates a linebreak and \t skips the texts.
message_1 = "Hey"
message_2 = " Paul "
message = "\n\t" + message_1 +""+ message_2
print(message)

# 6. Stripping whitspaces with left right and both using : lstrip() and rstrip() and strip()
message_1 = " See this relationship isn't working out,"
message_2 = " Paul. So lets break-up "
message = "\n" + message_1.lstrip() +""+ message_2.strip() # lstrip adjusts the space in left and rstrip does the same in right
print(message)

# 7. Avoid syntax error's or read those error's and work properly
# 8. Integers: In terminal window we can use integers directly by performing symbold but here in editor need to print
print("\t")
print((9+8)-34)
# 9. Anything with decimal point is known as Float.
print(5.2+6.5)

# 10. Use integer as string
print("\t")
age = 25
message = "My name is paul and I am " + str(age) +"years old."
print(message)

# 11. Import this, this is nothing but a set of rules created by somebody
import this

# LESSON 2:
# 1.Lists name can be anything but needed to be enclosed with [] this square brackets.
print("\n")
print("LESSON 2:")
sons = ["jhon","sam","willy","victor","hecker"]
print(sons)
 # 1.a print individualy the values in the list
sons = ["jhon","sam","willy","victor","hecker"]
print(sons[2])
# 1.b Adding an extra element to the value
sons.append("Kernal")
print(sons)
# 1.c Modifying an exisiting value with another by assigning a new value
sons[2]="Fiasco"
print(sons)
# 1.d Here let's do something which is adding a value next to something I insist
sons.insert(-2,"Kanye")
print(sons)

print("\t")
# 2. There are three steps to delete an value from the variable using del space and pop() and the remove by value
sons = ["jhon","sam","willy","victor","hecker"]
del sons[0] # del space sons[0] and then the assigned value deletes things from the variable
print(sons)
 
# 2.a Now lets temporarily delete things from the box
sons.pop() # pop will remove the last element from the list
print(sons)
# 2.c Removing a value from the variable using value
sons = ["jhon","sam","willy","victor","hecker"]
sons.remove("victor") # There is going to be no = symbol when we remove a value 
print(sons)
print("\t")

# 3. Sort is somthing we going to use which alphabetically arranges the value in the list in ascending or descending order
sons = ["jhon","sam","willy","victor","hecker","Aaron"]
sons.sort()
print(sons)
sons.sort(reverse=True) # here I have reversed the list values alphabetically
print(sons)
print(sorted(sons)) # this automatically re reverses back to the actual state

# 4. Now let's define the Length of the value:
print("\t")
print(len(sons)) # This produces how many values are there in the list:

# 5. Looping this is one of the important thing to design with the list:
print("\t")
sons = ["jhon","sam","willy","victor","hecker"]
for son in sons:
 print(son)
print("\t")
sons = ["jhon","sam","willy","victor","hecker"]
sons.insert(-1,"Tom Cruise") # With this command a thing is added prior to the value in the variable
for son in sons:
	print(son)
# 5.a Now lets try to Loop with message via string:
sons = ["jhon","sam","willy","victor","hecker"]
print("\n")
for son in sons:
 print("Well done my boy, " + son )	
 print("You nailed it in the football match yesterday"+"\n")	# Placing \n here seperated the sentence

# 6. Range : which uses the same for but with value in the variable: for value in range(0,2):
for value in range(3,25,3):
	print(value) # Here this states the multiples of 3 until 25 but does now prints 25
	
value =[]
for value in range (2,15):
	print(value)
print("\t")

# 7. List using range: this produces the list in horizontal row
let_me_print_the_numbers = list(range(1,100))
print(let_me_print_the_numbers)
